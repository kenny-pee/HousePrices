This is an attempt on the Kaggle House prices competition. Attempts and results will be updated along the way as I progress on with this mini project.

## Files:

  The jupyter notebook coded for cleaning train.csv and test.csv
  
2) Train_clean.csv and Test_clean.csv
  
The csv files that have been cleaned using the .ipynb in 1). The catagorical variables are one hot encoded if they have no relation in magnitude, and coded in the sense of its importance/magnitude if there are. NaNs are filled with 0's as most of them refers to the variable being not present.
